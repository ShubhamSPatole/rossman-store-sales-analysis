# Rossman Store Sales Analysis and Prediction

This project analyzes the sales data from Rossman stores to predict future sales and identify patterns that drive performance. By leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques, this project reveals key insights on how promotions, competitor proximity, and day-of-week patterns influence sales outcomes.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Identify the impact of promotions on customer behavior and store sales.
- Analyze sales patterns to determine high and low performing days.
- Explore how competitor proximity affects store sales.
- Build a predictive model for future sales using machine learning.

## Data

The dataset used in this project consists of sales records from Rossman stores, containing information on:
- **Store ID**: Unique identifier for each store.
- **Sales**: Sales revenue for each store on a particular day.
- **Customers**: Number of customers for each store.
- **Promo**: Whether the store was running a promotion that day.
- **Competitor Distance**: Distance from the nearest competitor.
- **Day of Week**: Day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.).
  
The dataset can be found in the `data/` directory.

## Analysis

Key insights from the analysis:
- **Promotions**: Promotions led to a 20% increase in customer visits and a 15% boost in spending.
- **Sales Patterns**: Mondays and Sundays are the highest revenue days, while Saturdays show the lowest sales, with a 40% difference between peak and off-peak days.
- **Competitor Proximity**: Stores located near competitors have 12% higher sales, highlighting the importance of competitive positioning.

## Modeling

The project includes building a predictive model for sales using a neural network built in TensorFlow. The model was trained on the historical sales data to forecast future sales performance.

## Results

The predictive model accurately forecasts store sales, enabling better resource allocation, promotion strategy planning, and inventory management. This helps Rossman stores optimize their operations and improve profitability.

## Technologies Used

The following tools and libraries were used:
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations.
- **Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Plotly**: Interactive visualizations.
- **TensorFlow**: Machine learning and neural networks.
